 * Syslog utilities :) Really it doesn't have to be syslog specific but it's what fundraising
 * at MW has always used. This just serves as a convienent wrapper class for managing things I find
 * useful in logs.
 *
 * As to why am I reinventing the wheel for the nth time; well... MW's own logging mechanism sucks
 * and does not do what FR needs it to do; and PHPs debug_log() would also require a wrapper.
